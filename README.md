# TheGameRoom
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Game Room client is a web based game that is ran on multiple platforms. The client wanted the best version of this software that was only available for Andriod. The goal for this software is to be launched to all of the devices and platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The software design template layed out all the client's considerations. The template involves features like security, memory and storage, operating systems, and API framework. These features benefits the architectural structure to launch this product into other platforms. In this weeks discussion we learned about traditional and cloud operating systems. The cloud platform would be the best option for the goals and the client. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The domain model used UML classes to build the relationships between all the classes. The Entity class formed the relationship with Game, Team and Player classes. Entity plays the role of the Driver class. GameService  is a reference of Games, then Games is a reference to Team and Team is used as a reference to Player.  This process helped develope the classes method in more of a  direct way. This all developed a clean prototype.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The compare and contrast section sort of difficult to work with in a way. The three mobile platforms that were discussed were Mac, Windows and Linux. The web browser is a main-client concern. It runs the application for the client. A more indepth study of the platformns would introduce the technical and performance constraints. This would throughly explain a better difference of the three platforms types. This would give a deeper dive into all the platform options on the client side. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The usability is an important factor when developing web based apps. The layout of the app is an important part, it needs to be simple enough for everyone to use. The looks may not be as important when considering the lay out, it is less important than the speed and accessability. If the product isn't easy to comprehend or if it runs slower than normal,than people will leave the app being discouraged. The product consumer is who buys the app to use the product which benefits the revenue for the client. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The proper way to approach a project is start light with ideas and notes. When you start on something lightly it then is easier to work into making it detailed and more efficient. Working into iterations will help with the final solution of the development. By breaking out each section of development, it will give the developer time to process any new ideas that might arise in the process. Functional and technical requirements can both be broken apart that will outline the technical approach then to the functional fullfillments. Technical requirements will most likely be used in architecture, design templates and coding. These all working togther will produce a final solution.
